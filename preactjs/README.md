# TicTacToe PreactJS

This TicTacToe game is a simple sandbox project for experimenting with Preact. It's written in TypeScript and includes custom react hooks, context, and state management. An atomic-design approach is used to organize TSX files and minimal CSS is added to each component.

This project was bootstrapped with [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) using the [typescript template](https://github.com/preactjs-templates/typescript).
