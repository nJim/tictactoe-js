# TicTacToe ReactJS

This TicTacToe game is a simple sandbox project for experimenting with React. It's written in TypeScript and includes custom react hooks, context, and state management. An atomic-design approach is used to organize TSX files and minimal CSS is added to each component.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Comparing Frameworks

Part of this project is to compare ease of development, performance, and build size between multiple frameworks. I'll publish the findings in a future blog post.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch.
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
